# Optimization Problems
The repo covers several NP-Hard optmization problems. Each problem is provided with one or more linear programming (LP) formulation(s) and solved using CPLEX Optimizer and IBM ILOG CPLEX modeling tool.  Apart from linear programming, each problem is also formulated into the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) form. 
## Problems covered

- **Chromatic Number problem** 
- **Chromatic Sum problem** 
- **Degree-Contrained MST problem** 
- **Steiner Tree problem** 
- **Depth-Bounded Steiner Tree problem** - Also called **Hop-Constrained Steiner tree** problem.
