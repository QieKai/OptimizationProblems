# Bounded-Depth Minimum Spanning Tree problem (or Hop-Constraint MST)
A sub-problem of bounded-depth Steiner tree problem 
- **lp_DCMST** - A solver using Integer Programming model
- **qubo_formula** - QUBO formulation implementation. It takes an adjacent list input and output a QUBO matrix which can later be solved by a QUBO solver.
