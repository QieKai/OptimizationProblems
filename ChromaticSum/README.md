# Finding the Chromatic Sums of Graphs 

- **lp_solver_cplex** - A solver using Binary Integer Programming model
- **chromatic_sum_qubo.cpp** - QUBO formulation implementation. It takes an adjacent list input and output a QUBO matrix which can later be solved by a QUBO solver.  
- **qubo_solver_cplex** - A QUBO solver that takes a QUBO size and QUBO matrix as input.
